# 🧪 Routing Consistency - Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your dev server should be running at: **http://localhost:5173**

If not, start it:
```powershell
cd "D:\Projects\Nowy folder\frontend"
npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Homepage Sections
Visit: `http://localhost:5173/`

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Hero slider auto-plays every 5 seconds ✨

- [ ] Same CTA section at bottom
- [ ] Content doesn't touch the header (20px gap)
- [ ] White background
- [ ] Sequential animation delays work

**To Verify Consistency:**
1. Open homepage in one tab
2. Open `/projects` in another tab
3. Compare side-by-side → should be IDENTICAL

---

### Test 3: How We Work Route

- [ ] Gradient background (gray-50 to white)

**To Verify Consistency:**
1. Open homepage in one tab
2. Open `/how` in another tab
3. Compare side-by-side → should be IDENTICAL

---

### Test 4: Navigation Flow
**Steps:**
1. Start on homepage
2. Click "Проекти" in menu
3. Verify projects page loads
4. Click "Як ми працюємо" in menu
5. Verify how page loads
6. Click "Home" to return
7. All pages should load smoothly

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Navigation links highlight active page (red color)

- [ ] No layout shifts or jumps
- [ ] Header stays fixed at top
- [ ] Footer appears on all pages

---

### Test 5: Responsive Design

#### Mobile View (< 640px)
**Resize browser or use DevTools mobile view**

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Projects cards stack vertically (1 column)
- [ ] How We Work cards stack vertically
- [ ] Images remain full-width
- [ ] Text is readable
- [ ] Buttons are tappable
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

#### Tablet View (640px - 1024px)
**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Projects show 2 columns
- [ ] How We Work shows 2 columns
- [ ] Images scale appropriately
- [ ] Spacing looks balanced

#### Desktop View (> 1024px)
**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Projects show 4 columns
- [ ] How We Work shows 2 columns (by design)
- [ ] Layout uses max-width container
- [ ] Content centered on page

---

### Test 6: Animations

**On Each Page:**
1. Scroll slowly from top to bottom
2. Watch elements animate as they enter viewport

**Expected Behaviors:**
- [ ] Elements fade in with upward motion
- [ ] Sequential delays (cards appear one after another)
- [ ] Animations only play once (not on scroll back up)
- [ ] Hover effects work (scale, shadow, color change)
- [ ] Progress bars animate from left to right
- [ ] Smooth transitions (no jank or stutter)

---

### Test 7: Browser Compatibility

Test in multiple browsers:
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if on Mac)

All animations and layouts should work consistently.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution:**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Page shows old content
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart dev server

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution:**
- Check internet connection (images from Unsplash CDN)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify component imports are correct

### Issue: Animations not working
**Solution:**
- Verify `framer-motion` is installed
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure components are properly imported

### Issue: Header overlaps content
**Solution:**
- Verify pages have `pt-20` class
- Check that header has `sticky top-0` classes
- Inspect with DevTools to see spacing

## 🎯 Key Routes to Test

| Route | Expected Content |
|-------|------------------|
| `/` | Full homepage with all sections |
| `/projects` | Only projects section (same as homepage) |
| `/how` | Only workflow section (same as homepage) |
| `/about` | About page (unchanged) |
| `/donate` | Donation page (unchanged) |
| `/contact` | Contact page (unchanged) |

## 📊 Component Reuse Verification

Open DevTools and check React components:

**Homepage:**
```
Home
  └── Projects (component)
  └── HowWeWorkNew (component)
```

**Projects Page:**
```
ProjectsPage
  └── Projects (component) ← SAME!
```

**How Page:**
```
HowPage
  └── HowWeWorkNew (component) ← SAME!
```

If you see the same component names, consistency is achieved! ✅

---

## 🎉 Expected Result

After all tests pass, you should have:

✅ **Unified Experience:** All pages use the same modern components  
✅ **Consistent Design:** Same animations, colors, spacing everywhere  
✅ **Easier Maintenance:** Update once, reflects everywhere  
✅ **Professional Look:** Smooth, polished user experience  
✅ **Better Performance:** No unnecessary API calls  
✅ **Mobile Friendly:** Responsive on all devices
